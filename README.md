# Survival Prediction on Titanic Passengers Using Bayesian Networks

## Abstract

This project forecasts the survival probability of passengers on the Titanic using Bayesian Networks, a form of probabilistic graphical models. The analysis aims to reveal features that determine survival rates based on factors such as age, gender, and ticket class. The dataset used is sourced from Kaggle and includes passenger details like 'Pclass,' 'Sex,' 'Age,' 'Fare,' 'Embarked,' 'Parch,' and 'SibSp.' The performance of the Bayesian Network model is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Introduction

The Titanic disaster on April 15, 1912, has been extensively studied to identify determinants of passenger survival. This project applies Bayesian Networks to predict survival probabilities using multiple variables from the Titanic dataset, such as gender, age, status, and ticket class. The goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these factors influenced survival rates.

## Problem Description and Dataset

The problem addressed in this project is predicting the chances of death or survival of Titanic passengers using Bayesian Networks. The dataset includes variables like 'Pclass,' 'Sex,' 'Age,' 'Fare,' 'Embarked,' 'Parch,' and 'SibSp,' which are significant for creating the predictive model. The dataset is cleaned, and categorical data are transformed into numerical values for compatibility with the Bayesian Network model.

## Methodology

### Bayesian Network Analysis

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handling missing values using the forward fill method.
   - Converting categorical data to numerical data.
   - Dropping irrelevant columns such as 'Name,' 'Ticket,' and 'Cabin.'
   - Partitioning the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

2. **Bayesian Network Construction**:
   - Defining the structure of the Bayesian Network, where variables directly impact the 'Survived' variable.
   - Fitting the model using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to find conditional probability functions for each node.

3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - **Accuracy**: Measure of the model's overall prediction performance.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: Detailed representation of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
   - **Classification Report**: Precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.

## Results

The Bayesian Network model effectively predicted survival probabilities and identified key factors such as passenger class, gender, and age. The model's high accuracy and balanced confusion matrix demonstrate its reliability. The classification report confirmed the model's efficiency in predicting survival outcomes.

## Ethical Considerations

The study addresses ethical issues such as bias in historical data and the need for data privacy and protection. The approach ensures that the research meets ethical standards and respects the rights of individuals represented in the data.

## Conclusion

The Bayesian Network model provided valuable insights into the factors influencing Titanic passengers' survival. The analysis confirmed that first-class passengers and females had higher chances of survival, aligning with historical records. Future studies could explore additional variables or use more advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance prediction accuracy.

## Fuzzy Logic Controller for Intelligent Assistive Care Environment and the FuzzyLite System

## Introduction

Technological development in the health sector has advanced to enhance patients' lives through intelligent systems. This project focuses on designing a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) for an intelligent assistive care environment using the FuzzyLite system. The main objective is to manage critical environmental conditions such as temperature, light, and humidity in care facilities.

## Problem Description

Traditional control systems are rigid and do not readily adapt to changes in care settings, potentially leading to poor climatic conditions. The FLC, utilizing fuzzy logic, provides greater and individualized control of the environment by constantly monitoring data and making precise adjustments through actuators.

## Methodology

### Design of Fuzzy Logic Controller

1. **Identifying Key Environmental Variables**:
   - Temperature: Low, Medium, High (triangular membership function)
   - Light Intensity: Dim, Moderate, Bright (trapezoidal fuzzy sets)
   - Humidity: Dry, Normal, Humid (Gaussian membership functions)

2. **Development of Fuzzy Rules**:
   - Example: If the temperature is high and humidity is low, lower the temperature and raise the humidity.

### Implementation Using FuzzyLite

1. **FuzzyLite Installation and Setup**: Integration with environmental control hardware.
2. **Development of Fuzzy Rules**: Feeding predefined fuzzy rules into FuzzyLite.
3. **FLC Development**:
   - **Fuzzification**: Converting sensor outputs to fuzzy sets.
   - **Rule Base Evaluation**: Applying fuzzy rules to input values.
   - **Defuzzification**: Converting fuzzy outputs to crisp values for actuators.

### Optimization Techniques

Enhanced optimization techniques like Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) were explored. PSO showed better performance in terms of convergence time and computational complexity and was implemented in the FLC.

## Analysis and Evaluation

### Performance Testing

1. **Response Time**: Speed of the system's adaptation to environmental changes.
2. **Accuracy**: Precision of environmental regulation.
3. **Stability**: Consistency of the system in maintaining climatic conditions.

The FLC with PSO integration provided accurate, rapid, and stable environmental control, improving occupant comfort and well-being.

## Conclusion

The FLC developed using FuzzyLite efficiently controls environmental parameters in an assistive care setting. The integration of PSO optimization techniques enhanced performance, demonstrating the potential for adaptable and timely intelligent care systems.
